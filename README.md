# movies

My name is Isaac Storch, and this is my github repository for a little data science side project that I am working on.

The ultimate goal is to be able to use machine learning algorithms to predict the scores that critics will assign to a new movie.

So far, I have just made a Python script called "scrape.py" that pulls movie data from a couple of open APIs and stores it in a MySQL database. I am currently working on an IPython notebook that analyzes the data and I will upload it here when I get some interesting results.
