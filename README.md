# movies

This was a data science side project that I worked on after graduating with my Ph.D. and before my first industry job at OpenX.

The ultimate goal is to be able to use machine learning algorithms to predict the scores that critics will assign to a new movie.

So far, I have made a Python script called "scrape.py" that pulls movie data from a couple of open APIs and stores it in a MySQL database. I have also written a jupyter notebook that does some preliminary studies on the movie genres, including linear regression and PCA.
